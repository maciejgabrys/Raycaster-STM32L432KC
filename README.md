# Raycaster-STM32L432KC
Real-time raycaster game engine written from scratch for a STM32 L432KC prototype board.


# Mathematics
The approach implemented here is my own take on the raycasting. It does not use a traditional 2D array to represent the world (like in Wolfenstein 3D). Instead, the world here is represented in a complex space where each wall is just a pair of points (and an assigned texture). What is great about this approach is that it allows to create more complicated rooms or even move walls (doors) in real-time, although this feature is still waiting to be implemented... ðŸ˜‰

This code was written in C99 to take benefit of the _complex_ floating-point types. It runs on an 80MHz STM32 MCU with only 64kB of SRAM, and it does it quite smoothly.
